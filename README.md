# Neovim 0.11 Setup

This repository contains my personal _modern_ Neovim v0.11 configuration setup. That is, a setup that leverages the latest minimal, yet debloated Neovim way to set up language servers via `vim.lsp.config` and `vim.lsp.enable`.

Other Neovim setups that have inspired this one include: [jdhao](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config) and [tonybanters](https://github.com/tonybanters/nvim) configurations.
