# Neovim 0.11 Config

This repository contains my personal minimal, yet _modern_ Neovim [v0.11](https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.11.html) configuration. 
That is, a setup that leverages the latest debloated Neovim way to set up language servers via `vim.lsp.config` and `vim.lsp.enable`.
Also, it uses [`CodeCompanion`](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim) to handle AI-assisted coding, especially for AI agents via ACP.

## Credits

Other Neovim setups that have inspired this one include: [jdhao](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config) and [tonybanters](https://github.com/tonybanters/nvim) configurations.
